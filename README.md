# The Fury of Dracula
This is our repository for The Fury of Dracula assignment 2 for COMP1927, semester 2, 2015.

## To the group members
Check back on this page a lot throughout the project. I recommend having e-mail notifications every time a commit is made, as it'll tell you who's working on this, and what they've done. You don't have to sync every single time you edit the code, but it's recommended you commit every time you take a break.

Otherwise, check the **issues** page to see what needs to be done. If you're up for something, assign the issue to yourself so everyone knows you're working on it. If you need clarification or a discussion on an area, just post some comments on the issue.

There's _(maybe)_ two deadlines that we need to hit, so make sure that we all do work _consistently_ rather than at the last moment.
